# Contributing to the xFormers repo

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

## Our Development Process

Minor changes and improvements will be released on an ongoing basis. Larger
changes (e.g., changesets implementing a new paper) will be released on a
more periodic basis.

## Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")

In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need
to do this once to work on any of Facebook's open source projects.

Complete your CLA here: <https://code.facebook.com/cla>

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.

## Environment setup

```bash
~$ python3 -m venv venv2
~$ source venv2/bin/activate
(venv2) ~$ cd git/template/
(venv2) ~/git/template $ pip3 install -r requirements-test.txt
```

## Coding Style

In your editor, install the [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) extension
which should ensure that you are following the same standards as us.

Two options to make sure that the code is formatted and linted properly:
* either you run mypy and ufmt before opening up your PR.

```bash
ufmt format
flake8 --config .flake8
mypy --ignore-missing-imports --scripts-are-modules --pretty --exclude build/ --exclude stubs/ .
```

* or you can just install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), which will make sure that all of the above is run automatically anytime you commit
in that case, you would need to
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```
then (in the xformers repository, just once)
```bash
pre-commit install
```

After these steps each of your commits will run the same linting and formatting routines as the xformers continuous integration, which greatly helps getting your PRs all green !

_Read the [editorconfig](.editorconfig) file to understand the exact coding style preferences._

## Testing

### Static analysis

```bash
mypy --ignore-missing-imports --scripts-are-modules --pretty --exclude stubs/ .
```

### Unit tests

```bash
pytest
```

or

``` bash
python -m pytest
```

### Check test coverage

``` bash
python -m pytest --cov-report term --cov=template  tests
```

### CircleCI status

From your PR page, you can expand on the CircleCI results. For GPU test, you should see
what CI has run, like:

``` bash
...
----- generated xml file: /home/circleci/template/test-results/junit.xml ------
================== 217 passed, 2 xfailed in 218.74s (0:03:38) ==================
CircleCI received exit code 0
```

The number of passed and failed should give you an idea on whether your local
test was the same or not.

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the same guidelines as AngularJS. Each commit message consists of a **header**,
a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special format that includes a **type**,
and a **subject**:

```bash
[<type>] <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on github as well as in various git tools.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **cleanup**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, dead code removal etc.)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests or fixing them
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
generation
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
