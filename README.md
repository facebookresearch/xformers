## xFormers - Toolbox to Accelerate Research on Transformers

xFormers is:
- **Customizable building blocks**: Independent/customizable building blocks that can be used without boilerplate code. The components are domain-agnostic and xFormers is used by researchers in vision, NLP and more.
- **Research first**: xFormers contains bleeding-edge components, that are not yet available in mainstream libraries like PyTorch.
- **Built with efficiency in mind**: Because speed of iteration matters, components are as fast and memory-efficient as possible. xFormers contains its own CUDA kernels, but dispatches to other libraries when relevant.

## Installing xFormers

* **(RECOMMENDED, linux) Install latest stable with conda**: Requires [PyTorch 2.4.0 installed with conda](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

```bash
conda install xformers -c xformers
```

* **(RECOMMENDED, linux & win) Install latest stable with pip**: Requires [PyTorch 2.4.0](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

```bash
# cuda 11.8 version
pip3 install -U xformers --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
# cuda 12.1 version
pip3 install -U xformers --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

* **Development binaries**:

```bash
# Use either conda or pip, same requirements as for the stable version above
conda install xformers -c xformers/label/dev
pip install --pre -U xformers
```

* **Install from source**: If you want to use with another version of PyTorch for instance (including nightly-releases)

```bash
# (Optional) Makes the build much faster
pip install ninja
# Set TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST if running and building on different GPU types
pip install -v -U git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers.git@main#egg=xformers
# (this can take dozens of minutes)
```


## Benchmarks

**Memory-efficient MHA**
![Benchmarks for ViTS](./docs/plots/mha/mha_vit.png)
*Setup: A100 on f16, measured total time for a forward+backward pass*

Note that this is exact attention, not an approximation, just by calling [`xformers.ops.memory_efficient_attention`](https://facebookresearch.github.io/xformers/components/ops.html#xformers.ops.memory_efficient_attention)

**More benchmarks**

xFormers provides many components, and more benchmarks are available in [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md).

### (Optional) Testing the installation

This command will provide information on an xFormers installation, and what kernels are built/available:

```python
python -m xformers.info
```

## Using xFormers

### Transformers key concepts

Let's start from a classical overview of the Transformer architecture (illustration from Lin et al,, "A Survey of Transformers")
<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/assets/Transformer_arch_Lin_et_al.png" width=600>
</p>

You'll find the key repository boundaries in this illustration: a Transformer is generally made of a collection of attention mechanisms, embeddings to encode some positional information, feed-forward blocks and a residual path (typically referred to as pre- or post- layer norm). These boundaries do not work for all models, but we found in practice that given some accommodations it could capture most of the state of the art.

Models are thus not implemented in monolithic files, which are typically complicated to handle and modify. Most of the concepts present in the above illustration correspond to an abstraction level, and when variants are present for a given sub-block it should always be possible to select any of them. You can focus on a given encapsulation level and modify it as needed.

<details><summary>Initializations </summary><p>
  This is completely optional, and will only occur when generating full models through xFormers, not when picking parts individually.

  There are basically two initialization mechanisms exposed, but the user is free to initialize weights as he/she sees fit after the fact.
  - Parts can expose a `init_weights()` method, which define sane defaults
  - xFormers supports [specific init schemes](xformers/factory/weight_init.py) which *can take precedence* over the init_weights()

  If the second code path is being used (construct model through the model factory), we check that all the weights have been initialized, and possibly error out if it's not the case
  (if you set `xformers.factory.weight_init.__assert_if_not_initialized = True`)

  Supported initialization schemes are:
  - [Small init](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05895)
  - [Timm defaults](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models/blob/master/timm/models/vision_transformer.py)
  - [ViT defaults](https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer)
  - [Moco v3 defaults](https://github.com/facebookresearch/moco-v3)

  One way to specify the init scheme is to set the `config.weight_init` field to the matching enum value.
  This could easily be extended, feel free to submit a PR !

### Install troubleshooting


* NVCC and the current CUDA runtime match. Depending on your setup, you may be able to change the CUDA runtime with `module unload cuda; module load cuda/xx.x`, possibly also `nvcc`
* the version of GCC that you're using matches the current NVCC capabilities
* the `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` env variable is set to the architectures that you want to support. A suggested setup (slow to build but comprehensive) is `export TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="6.0;6.1;6.2;7.0;7.2;7.5;8.0;8.6"`
* If the build from source OOMs, it's possible to reduce the parallelism of ninja with `MAX_JOBS` (eg `MAX_JOBS=2`)
* If you encounter [`UnsatisfiableError`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers/issues/390#issuecomment-1315020700) when installing with conda, make sure you have PyTorch installed in your conda environment, and that your setup (PyTorch version, cuda version, python version, OS) match [an existing binary for xFormers](https://anaconda.org/xformers/xformers/files)
