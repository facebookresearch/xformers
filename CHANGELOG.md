# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.0.28] - TBD
### Added
### Improved
- Profiler: Fix computation of FLOPS for the attention when using xFormers
- Profiler: Fix MFU/HFU calculation when multiple dtypes are used
- fMHA/splitK: Fixed `nan` in the output when using a `torch.Tensor` bias where a lot of consecutive keys are masked with `-inf`
- Update Flash-Attention version to `v2.6.3` *when building from scratch*
- When using the most recent version of Flash-Attention, it is no longer possible to mix it with the cutlass backend. In other words, it is no longer possible to use the cutlass Fw with the flash Bw.
### Removed
- fMHA: Removed `decoder` and `small_k` backends

## [0.0.27.post2] - 2024-07-26
Pre-built binary wheels require PyTorch 2.4.0

## [0.0.27.post1] - 2024-07-25
Pre-built binary wheels require PyTorch 2.4.0

## [0.0.27] - 2024-07-10
Pre-built binary wheels require PyTorch 2.3.1
### Added
- fMHA: `PagedBlockDiagonalGappyKeysMask`
- fMHA: heterogeneous queries in `triton_splitk`
- fMHA: support for paged attention in flash
- fMHA: Added backwards pass for `merge_attentions`
- fMHA: Added `torch.compile` support for 3 biases (`LowerTriangularMask`, `LowerTriangularMaskWithTensorBias` and `BlockDiagonalMask`) - some might require PyTorch 2.4
- fMHA: Added `torch.compile` support in `memory_efficient_attention` when passing the flash operator explicitely (eg `memory_efficient_attention(..., op=(flash.FwOp, flash.BwOp))`)
- fMHA: `memory_efficient_attention` now expects its `attn_bias` argument to be on the same device as the other input tensor. Previously, it would convert the bias to the right device.
- fMHA: `AttentionBias` subclasses are now constructed by default on the `cuda` device if available - they used to be created on the CPU device
- 2:4 sparsity: Added `xformers.ops.sp24.sparsify24_ste` for Straight Through Estimator (STE) with options to rescale the gradient differently for masked out/kept values
### Improved
- fMHA: Fixed out-of-bounds reading for Split-K triton implementation
- Profiler: fix bug with modules that take a single tuple as argument
- Profiler: Added manual trigger for a profiling step, by creating a `trigger` file in the profiling directory
### Removed
- Removed support for PyTorch version older than 2.2

## [0.0.26] - 2024-04-29
Pre-built binary wheels require PyTorch 2.3.0
### Added
- [2:4 sparsity] Added support for Straight-Through Estimator for `sparsify24` gradient (`GRADIENT_STE`)
- [2:4 sparsity] `sparsify24_like` now supports the cuSparseLt backend, and the STE gradient
- Basic support for `torch.compile` for the `memory_efficient_attention` operator. Currently only supports Flash-Attention, and without any bias provided. We want to expand this coverage progressively.
### Improved
- merge_attentions no longer needs inputs to be stacked.
- fMHA: triton_splitk now supports additive bias
- fMHA: benchmark cleanup

## [0.0.25.post1] - 2024-03-29
Pre-built binary wheels require PyTorch 2.2.2

## [0.0.25] - 2024-03-14
Pre-built binary wheels require PyTorch 2.2.1
### Added
- New `merge_attentions` function
- fMHA: New gappy attention biases.
### Improved
- fMHA: Updated Flash-Attention to v2.5.6: this has a performance improvement for multiquery.
- fMHA: triton_splitk changed and expanded. Now amalgamates using LSE. Can autotune, supports causal with a small number of queries - not just 1. Experimental support for paged attention.
- `rope_padded`: Fixed CUDA error with many queries (more than 65k)
- `rmsnorm`: Fixed CUDA error with large inputs (enables 512k+ sequence length on Llama2 70B)
### Removed
- fMHA: Removed triton operator (`fmha.triton.*`, `xformers.ops.MemoryEfficientAttentionTritonFwdFlashBwOp`, `xformers.ops.TritonFlashAttentionOp`), as it has correctness issues under some conditions, and is slower than other implementations.

## [0.0.24] - 2024-01-31
Pre-built binary wheels require PyTorch 2.2.0
### Added
- Added components for model/sequence parallelism, as near-drop-in replacements for FairScale/Megatron Column&RowParallelLinear modules. They support fusing communication and computation for sequence parallelism, thus making the communication effectively free. [Read more](https://twitter.com/d_haziza/status/1753030654118211593)
- Added kernels for training models with 2:4-sparsity. We introduced a very fast kernel for converting a matrix A into 24-sparse format, which can be used during training to sparsify weights dynamically, activations etc... xFormers also provides an API that is compatible with torch-compile, see `xformers.ops.sparsify24`.
### Improved
- Make selective activation checkpointing be compatible with torch.compile.
### Removed
- Triton kernels now require a GPU with compute capability 8.0 at least (A100 or newer). This is due to newer versions of triton not supporting older GPUs correctly
- Removed support for PyTorch version older than 2.1.0

## [0.0.23] - 2023-12-05
Pre-built binary wheels require PyTorch 2.1.1 (xFormers `0.0.23`) or PyTorch 2.1.2 (xFormers `0.0.23.post1`).
### Fixed
- fMHA: Fixed a bug in cutlass backend forward pass where the logsumexp was not correctly calculated, resulting in wrong results in the BW pass. This would happen with MQA when one sequence has a query with `length%64 == 1`
- fMHA: Updated Flash-Attention to v2.3.6 - this fixes a performance regression in causal backward passes, and now supports `BlockDiagonalCausalWithOffsetPaddedKeysMask`
### Added
- fMHA: Added `LocalAttentionFromBottomRightMask` (local)
- fMHA: Added `LowerTriangularFromBottomRightMask` (causal)
- fMHA: Added `LowerTriangularFromBottomRightLocalAttentionMask` (local + causal)
### Removed
- Removed `xformers.triton.sum_strided`

## [0.0.22] - 2023-09-27
### Fixed
- fMHA: Backward pass now works in PyTorch deterministic mode (although slower)
### Added
- fMHA: Added experimental support for Multi-Query Attention and Grouped-Query Attention. This is handled by passing 5-dimensional inputs to `memory_efficient_attention`, see the documentation for more details
- fMHA: Added experimental support for Local Attention biases to `memory_efficient_attention`
- Added an example of efficient [LLaMa decoding](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers/tree/main/examples/llama_inference) using xformers operators
- Added Flash-Decoding for faster attention during Large Language Model (LLM) decoding - up to 50x faster for long sequences (token decoding up to 8x faster end-to-end)
- Added an efficient rope implementation in triton, to be used in LLM decoding
- Added selective activation checkpointing, which gives fine-grained control of which activations to keep and which activations to recompute
- `xformers.info` now indicates the Flash-Attention version used
### Removed
- fMHA: Removed `smallK` backend support for CPU. `memory_efficient_attention` only works for CUDA/GPU tensors now
- **DEPRECATION**: Many classes in `xformers.factory`, `xformers.triton` and `xformers.components` have been or will be deprecated soon (see tracking issue facebookresearch/xformers#848)

## [0.0.21] - 2023-08-18
### Improved
- fMHA: Updated [flash-attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) to v2, with massive performance improvements for both the forward pass and backward pass. This implementation is now used by default when it's available
### Bug fixes
- fMHA/cutlass: Fix potential race condition in the FW/BW passes
- fMHA/cutlass: Fix `attn_bias` stride overflow for very long sequences (>32k)
- `LowerTriangularMask` is now backward compatible with older xformers versions
### Breaking changes
- `memory_efficient_attention` now expects the `attn_bias` argument to have a head dimension
- `memory_efficient_attention` no longer broadcasts the batch/head dimensions of `attn_bias`. Please use `.expand` if you need to broadcast the bias
- Remove `causal_diagonal` argument from `BlockDiagonalCausalWithOffsetPaddedKeysMask`
### Added
- Binary wheels on pypi/conda now contain H100 kernels
- fMHA: Added backend specialized for decoding that does not use TensorCores - useful when not using multiquery

**NOTE**: Binary wheels are now provided only for PyTorch 2 with cuda 11.8. It is still possible to use xFormers with older versions of PyTorch by building from source or using conda.

## [0.0.18] - 2023-03-31

## [0.0.17] - 2023-03-28
### Fixed
